For class 0, the precision is 0.46, meaning 46% of the instances predicted as class 0 were indeed class 0. For class 1, the precision is 0.52, indicating 52% of the instances predicted as class 1 were true positives.\n","\n","**Recall (Sensitivity):**\n","\n","Recall, or True Positive Rate, measures how well the model identifies actual positives. For class 0, the recall is 0.22, indicating that only 22% of the true class 0 instances were correctly predicted. For class 1, recall is higher at 0.77, meaning 77% of the true class 1 instances were correctly identified.\n","\n","**F1-Score:**\n","\n","The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced metric when you want to consider both false positives and false negatives. For class 0, the F1-score is 0.29, and for class 1, it’s 0.62. A higher F1-score indicates a better balance between precision and recall.\n","\n","**Support:**\n","\n","Support reflects the number of instances in each class. Here, there are 581 instances of class 0 and 650 instances of class 1 in the dataset.\n","\n","**Accuracy:**\n","\n","Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model by calculating the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions. In this case, the model’s overall accuracy is 51%.\n","\n","**Macro Average & Weighted Average:**\n","\n","- The **macro average** is the unweighted average of precision, recall, and F1-score across both classes, treating them equally.\n","- The **weighted average** takes into account the number of instances in each class, giving more weight to classes with higher support.
